# Chemistry-Terminal-Script
Basic Python Script for solving various chemistry equations in the Terminal

## Project is being overhauled
The code is very old, I am re-writing the program to be more efficient an readable

## Goal
Input: group of variables \n
Output: all variables that can be derived from the input variables recursively

Modular: Easy to add more equations, constants, variables, etc.. 
Easy to Iterate on
